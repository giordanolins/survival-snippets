Gradle Console Error:

error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Solution:
=======

After checking to which package does the libz.so.1 belongs (http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/i386/zlib1g/filelist) 
you should try to install zlib1g:

sudo apt-get install zlib1g

As pointed by @E-rich, it may be required to add a :i386 suffix to the package name for the package manager 
correctly identify it:

---------------------------------

sudo apt-get install zlib1g:i386

---------------------------------

CentoOS: yum install zlib.i686


This worked for me

    sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 lib32ncurses5
